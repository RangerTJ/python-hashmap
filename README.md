# Python Hashmaps
Implementation of a hashmap for use in python, using both seperate-chaining (SC) and open address (OA) methods. 

Built using portions of provided code for the final assignment for Oregen State University's CS-261 Data Structures course. Provided code includes a6_include.py (sans my introductory comment) and parts cited/annotated as provided in public_hash_map_oa.py and public_hash_map_sc.py.
