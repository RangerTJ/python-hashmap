# Python Hashmaps
Two different implementation of a hashmap for use in python are provided here - seperate-chaining (SC) and open address (OA) approaches. 

Created as my portfolio assignment for Oregen State University's CS-261 Data Structures course. Incorporates limited amounts of provided code used to build a foundation for things like dynamic arrays, linked lists, etc. (as the course banned use of built-in Python data structures). OSU-provided code includes a6_include.py (sans my introductory comment) and parts cited/annotated as provided in public_hash_map_oa.py and public_hash_map_sc.py.
