# python-hashmap
Implementation of a hashmap for use in python, using both seperate-chaining and open address methods.

Files to be uploaded pending approval/edits.
[Self-note: just replace all DA stuff with python lists, since they're the same... for linked lists maybe use python collections module's deque object]
